# Unity_MetaBalls_Liquids
A simple liquid simulation using [MetaBalls](https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=MetaBalls).

  </p>
  
 The basic MetaBalls are balls moving by simple math functions, good to quickly test the concepts but not easy to use right away.

### After

</p>

The new MetaBalls are based on the same come with some improvements, such as gravity, collisions and grounded water effect (the metaballs "splash" when hitting the ground).
